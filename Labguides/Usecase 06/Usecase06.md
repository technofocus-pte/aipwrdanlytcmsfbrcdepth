# Use Case 06: Real-Time Analytics and Data Warehousing with AbboCost in Microsoft Fabric

**Introduction**

In this lab, you will start by rapidly generating real-time data and
understanding how that data can be processed and visualized in Microsoft
Fabric. With the initial reporting in place, multiple modules are
available that explore data warehousing, data lakehouse architecture,
data activator, data science, and of course, real-time analytics. The
modules are designed to be cohesive but flexible -- they all involve the
same core scenario but have limited dependencies so you can consume the
modules that make the most sense for you.

The basic architecture of the solution is illustrated below. The app
deployed in the beginning of this lab (either as a docker container or
running in Jupyter notebook) will publish events to our Fabric
environment. The data is ingested into a KQL database for real-time
reporting in Power BI.

In this lab, you'll get hands-on with a fictitious financial company
"AbboCost." AbboCost would like to set up a stock monitoring platform to
monitor price fluctuations and report on historical data. Throughout the
workshop, we'll look at how every aspect of Microsoft Fabric can be
incorporated as part of a larger solution -- by having everything in an
integrated solution, you'll be able to quickly and securely integrate
data, build reports, create data warehouses and lakehouses, forecast
using ML models, and more.

Now that our data is streaming into our KQL database, we can begin to
query and explore the data, leveraging KQL to gain insights into the
data. A KQL queryset is used to run queries, view, and transform data
from a KQL database. Like other artifacts, a KQL queryset exists within
the context of a workspace. A queryset can contain multiple queries each
stored in a tab. In this exercise, we'll create several KQL queries of
increasing complexity to support different business uses.

You will build a Synapse Data Warehouse inside Microsoft Fabric to
aggregate data from the KQL database. In Microsoft Fabric, there are two
primary ways to build a data warehouse: using a Synapse Data Warehouse,
the focus of this module, and a lakehouse.

A Synapse Data Warehouse stores its data in OneLake in Delta/Parquet
format similar to lakehouse tables. However, only Synapse Data Warehouse
offers read/write on the T-SQL endpoint. If you are migrating a data
warehouse or more familiar with T-SQL development, using a Synapse Data
Warehouse is a logical choice.

**Objectives**

- Redeem Azure Pass, and configure necessary permissions within the
  Azure portal.  
- Create fabric workspace.  
- To deploy the stock generator app via Azure Container Instance using
  an ARM template.  
- To configure Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric for ingesting real-time
  data from Azure Event Hubs, ensuring seamless integration and data
  preview for subsequent analysis.  
- To create a KQL database within Microsoft Fabric and send data from
  Eventstream to the  
- KQL database.  
- To explore stock price data using KQL, progressively developing
  queries to analyze trends, calculate price differentials, and
  visualize data for actionable insights.  
- To leverage Power BI to create dynamic, real-time reports based on
  analyzed stock data, configuring auto-refresh settings for timely
  updates and enhancing visualization for informed decision-making.  
- Create a Synapse Data Warehouse within the Fabric workspace and create
  essential staging and ETL objects to facilitate data processing and
  transformation.  
- Build a data pipeline for efficiently extracting, transforming, and
  loading (ETL) data from source systems into the Synapse Data
  Warehouse, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.  
- Create dimension and fact tables within the data warehouse to organize
  and store structured data efficiently for analytical purposes.  
- Implement procedures to incrementally load data into the data
  warehouse, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets while
  maintaining data integrity.  
- Create views to support data aggregation during the ETL process,
  optimizing data processing and improving pipeline performance.  
- Create semantic model in Synapse Data Warehouse, define table
  relationships, and generate a Power BI report for data visualization.

## Exercise 1: Environment Setup

To follow the lab exercises, a set of resources must be provisioned. At
the heart of the scenario is the real-time stock price generator script
that generates a continuous stream of stock prices that are used
throughout the workshop.

We recommend deploying the stock price generator via Azure Container
Instance because the default Spark cluster will consume a large number
of resources.

### Task 1: Create a Fabric workspace

## Exercise 2: KQL Database Configuration and Ingestion

Now that our environment is fully configured, we will complete the
ingestion of the Eventstream, so that the data is ingested into a KQL
database. This data will also be stored in Fabric OneLake.

### Task 1: Create KQL Database

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is the query language used by Real-Time
analytics in Microsoft Fabric along with several other solutions, like
Azure Data Explorer, Log Analytics, Microsoft 365 Defender, etc. Similar
to Structured Query Language (SQL), KQL is optimized for ad-hoc queries
over big data, time series data, and data transformation.

To work with the data, we'll create a KQL database and stream data from
the Eventstream into the KQL DB.

1.  In the left-sided navigation menu, navigate and click on **RealTime
    workspace@lab.LabInstance.Id**, as shown in the below image.

    > ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/aipwrdanlytcmsfbrcdepth/refs/heads/Cloud-slice/Labguides/Usecase%2006/media/image30.png)

2.  In the **Real-Time Intelligence** page, select +**New item**
    and then filter by, and select, **+++Eventhouse+++** to create Eventhouse.

4.  On the KQL settings, select **Direct ingestion**. While we have the
    opportunity to process event data at this stage, for our purposes,
    we will ingest the data directly into the KQL database. Set the
    destination name to **+++KQL+++**, then select your **workspace,
    Eventhouse** and KQL database created in the above task, then click
    on **Save** button.

### Task 2: New Query of StockByTime

1.  Create a new tab within the queryset by clicking on the **+** icon
    as shown in the below image. Rename this tab as
    +++**StockByTime**+++

    >[!knowledge]We can begin to add our own calculations, such as calculating the
    >change over time. For example,
    >the [prev()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/prevfunction) function,

    >addition, as the previous price values are stock symbol specific, we
    >can [partition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/partition-operator) the
    >data when making calculations.

3.  In the query editor, copy and paste the following code. Click on
    the **Run** button to execute the query. After the query is
    executed, you will see the results.
	
    ```
    StockPrice
    | where timestamp > ago(75m)
    | project symbol, price, timestamp
    | partition by symbol
    (
        order by timestamp asc
        | extend prev_price = prev(price, 1)
        | extend prev_price_10min = prev(price, 600)
    )
    | where timestamp > ago(60m)
    | order by timestamp asc, symbol asc
    | extend pricedifference_10min = round(price - prev_price_10min, 2)
    | extend percentdifference_10min = round(round(price - prev_price_10min, 2) / prev_price_10min, 4)
    | order by timestamp asc, symbol asc
    ```
	
    > ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/aipwrdanlytcmsfbrcdepth/refs/heads/Cloud-slice/Labguides/Usecase%2006/media/image63.png)

In this KQL query, the results are first limited to the most recent
75 minutes. While we ultimately limit the rows to the last 60
minutes, our initial dataset needs enough data to lookup previous
values. The data is then partitioned to group the data by symbol,
and we look at the previous price (from 1 second ago) as well as the
previous price from 10 minutes ago. Note that this query assumes
data is generated at 1 second intervals. For the purposes of our
data, subtle fluctuations are acceptable. However, if you need
precision in these calculations (such as exactly 10 minutes ago and
not 9:59 or 10:01), you'd need to approach this differently.

### Task 3: StockAggregate

1.  Create another new tab within the queryset by clicking on
    the **+** icon as shown in the below image. Rename this tab as
    **+++StockAggregate+++**

3.  In the query editor, copy and paste the following code. Click on
    the **Run** button to execute the query. After the query is
    executed, you will see the results.
	
    ```

This is particularly useful when creating reports that aggregate real-time data over a longer time period.

### Task 5: Visualizations

1.  Create a final new tab within the queryset by clicking on
    the **+** icon as shown in the below image. Rename this tab as
    **+++Visualizations+++**. We'll use this tab to explore
    visualizing data.

### Task 4: Configuring the report to auto-refresh

1.  Deselect the chart. On the **Visualizations settings** \> **Format page**,
    enable **Page refresh** to automatically refresh every second or
    two, based on your preference. Of course, realistically we need to
    balance the performance implications of refresh frequency, user
    demand, and system resources.

### Task 2: Create the staging and ETL objects

In this task you will run a query that creates the staging tables that will
hold the data during the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process.
This will also create the two schemas used -- *stg* and *ETL*;
schemas help group workloads by type or function. The *stg* schema
is for staging and contains intermediate tables for the ETL process.
The *ETL* schema contains queries used for data movement, as well as
a single table for tracking state.

>[!note]**Note**: The begin date for the watermark is arbitrarily chosen as
>some previous date (1/1/2022), ensuring all data is captured -- this
>date will be updated on each successful run.

3.  In the query editor, copy and paste the following code. Click on
    the **Run** button to execute the query. After the query is
    executed, you will see the results.
	
    ```

## Exercise 6: Build Star Schema

For the date dimension, we'll load enough values for the foreseeable
future. Date dimensions are fairly similar across all implementations
and typically hold specific date details: the day of week, month,
quarter, etc.

For the symbol dimension, we'll incrementally load that during the
pipeline -- this way, if new stocks are added at some point, they will
get added to the Symbol dimension table during the execution of the
pipeline. The symbol dimension holds additional details about each
symbol, such as company name, the stock market it trades on, etc.

We'll also create views to support the pipeline by making it easier to
load data from the staging table by aggregating the min, max, and
closing price of the stock.

### Task 1: Create the dimension and fact tables

1.  Click on  **New SQL query**  dropdown in the command bar, then
    select **New SQL query**. We'll start
    building our schema in the next step.

	>[!knowledge]In our data warehouse, run the following SQL to create the fact and
    >dimension tables. As in the previous step, you can run this ad-hoc
    >or create a SQL query to save the query for future use.

3.  In the query editor, copy and paste the following code. Click on
    the **Run** button to execute the query. After the query is
    executed, you will see the results.

business case, but this could be run frequently (every few minutes)
or throughout the day.

> at least twice per day to stay current.

    every few minutes.

## Exercise 7: Semantic Modeling

One last step is to operationalize the data by creating a semantic model
and viewing the data in Power BI. 

### Task 1: Create a semantic model

A semantic model, conceptually, provides an abstraction of our data for
consumption in business analytics. Typically, we expose data in our data
warehouse via semantic model that is used in Power BI. At a basic level,
they will include the relationships between tables.

*Note: Power BI Datasets have recently been renamed to Semantic Models.
In some cases, labels may not have been updated. The terms can be used
interchangeably. Read more about this change [on the Power BI
Blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/datasets-renamed-to-semantic-models/).*

When we created our data warehouse, a default semantic model was created
automatically. We can leverage this in Power BI, but it also includes
many artifacts of the table we may not need. So, we'll create a new
semantic model with just our fact and two-dimension tables.

## **Summary**

In this usecase, you've configured permissions and created
necessary resources within the Azure portal such as Fabric Capacity,
Workspace, and Storage Account. Then, you've deployed the stock
generator app via Azure Container Instance using an ARM template to
generate real-time stock data. Additionally, you've configured
Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric to ingest data from Azure Event Hubs and
prepared the KQL Database to store this data efficiently. In this lab,
you've established a fully functional environment to proceed with
subsequent lab exercises related to real-time analytics and data
processing.

You embarked on a comprehensive exploration of stock price data using
Kusto Query Language (KQL). Starting with the creation of a KQL queryset
named "StockQueryset," you executed a series of increasingly complex
queries to analyze various facets of the data. From viewing sample
records to calculating price differentials over time and identifying
significant price gains, each query unveils valuable insights into the
dynamics of stock prices. By leveraging windowing functions, aggregation
techniques, and data partitioning, you gained a deeper understanding of
stock price trends and fluctuations.

Then, you've shifted the focus to optimizing Power BI reporting
efficiency, where you configured refresh rates and crafted dynamic
visualizations for real-time dashboards. By configuring refresh rates in
the Power BI admin portal and creating Power BI reports based on the
previously defined KQL queries, you ensured timely updates and enabled
insightful visualization of stock price data. Through tasks like
creating visualizations for percent change and configuring auto-refresh
settings, you harnessed the full potential of Power BI to drive informed
decision-making and enhanced business intelligence capabilities.

You've configured a Synapse Data Warehouse in the Fabric workspace and
established a robust data pipeline for data processing. You've begun
this lab with creating the Synapse Data Warehouse and then proceeded to
create staging and ETL objects necessary for data transformation. You've
created schemas, tables, stored procedures, and pipelines to manage data
flow efficiently.

Then, you've delved into building dimension and fact tables essential
for organizing data effectively for analytical purposes. You've created
tables for storing daily stock prices, symbol details, and date
information. Additionally, procedures are developed to load dimension
tables with relevant data and populate fact tables with daily stock
prices.

You've created a semantic model in Synapse Data Warehouse, focusing on
essential fact and dimension tables. After establishing the semantic
model named "StocksModel," you've established relationships between the
fact_Stocks_Daily_Prices table and the dim_Date and dim_Symbol tables to
enable cohesive data analysis. Overall, this lab provides a
comprehensive understanding of setting up a data warehouse environment
and building a reliable data pipeline for analytics.
