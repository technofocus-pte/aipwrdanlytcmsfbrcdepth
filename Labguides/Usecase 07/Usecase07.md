## Task 5: Load data into a dataframe

Now you’re ready to run code to get data and train a model. You’ll work
with the [diabetes
dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/open-datasets/dataset-diabetes?tabs=azureml-opendatasets?azure-portal=true) from
the Azure Open Datasets. After loading the data, you’ll convert the data
to a Pandas dataframe: a common structure for working with data in rows
and columns.

1.  In your notebook, use the **+ Code** icon below the latest cell
    output to add a new code cell to the notebook.

> **Tip**: To see the **+ Code** icon, move the mouse to just below and
> to the left of the output from the current cell. Alternatively, in the
> menu bar, on the **Edit** tab, select **+ Add code cell**.

2.  Enter the following code in it:
    ```
    # Azure storage access info for open dataset diabetes
    blob_account_name = "azureopendatastorage"
    blob_container_name = "mlsamples"
    blob_relative_path = "diabetes"
    blob_sas_token = r"" # Blank since container is Anonymous access
        
    # Set Spark config to access  blob storage
    wasbs_path = f"wasbs://%s@%s.blob.core.windows.net/%s" % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name, blob_relative_path)
    spark.conf.set("fs.azure.sas.%s.%s.blob.core.windows.net" % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name), blob_sas_token)
    print("Remote blob path: " + wasbs_path)
        
    # Spark read parquet, note that it won't load any data yet by now
    df = spark.read.parquet(wasbs_path)
    ```
> ![](./media/image25.png)

3.  Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.
    Alternatively, you can press **SHIFT** + **ENTER** on your keyboard
    to run a cell.

> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
> incorrect.](./media/image26.png)
>
> **Note**: Since this is the first time you’ve run any Spark code in
> this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the
> first run in the session can take a minute or so to complete.
> Subsequent runs will be quicker.

4.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it

    +++display(df)+++

5.  When the cell command has completed, review the output below the
    cell, which should look similar to this:

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](./media/image27.png)

> The output shows the rows and columns of the diabetes dataset

6.  The data is loaded as a Spark dataframe. Scikit-learn will expect
    the input dataset to be a Pandas dataframe. Run the code below to
    convert your dataset to a Pandas dataframe:
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    df = df.toPandas()
    df.head()
    ```

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image28.png)

## Task 6: Train a machine learning model

Now that you’ve loaded the data, you can use it to train a machine
learning model and predict customer churn. You’ll train a model using
the Scikit-Learn library and track the model with MLflow.

1.  Hover your mouse below the output cell, you’ll see the **+
    Code** icon. Click on the **+ Code** icon and enter the following
    code in the cell. Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the
    cell to run it
    ```
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        
    X, y = df[['AGE','SEX','BMI','BP','S1','S2','S3','S4','S5','S6']].values, df['Y'].values
        
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)
    ```

> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
> incorrect.](./media/image29.png)

2.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it:
    ```
    import mlflow
    experiment_name = "experiment-diabetes"
    mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)
    ```
> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
> incorrect.](./media/image30.png)

    The code creates an MLflow experiment named **experiment-diabetes**.
    Your models will be tracked in this experiment.

3.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it.
    ```
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        
    with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()
        
       model = LinearRegression()
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "LinearRegression")
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](./media/image31.png)
    
    The code trains a regression model using Linear Regression. Parameters,
    metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with MLflow.
    Additionally, you’re logging a parameter called **estimator** with the
    value **LinearRegression**.

4.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it.
    ```
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
        
    with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()
        
       model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5) 
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "DecisionTreeRegressor")
    ```
> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
> incorrect.](./media/image32.png)

The code trains a regression model using Decision Tree Regressor.
Parameters, metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with
MLflow. Additionally, you’re logging a parameter
called **estimator** with the value *DecisionTreeRegressor*.

## Task 7:Use MLflow to search and view your experiments

When you’ve trained and tracked models with MLflow, you can use the
MLflow library to retrieve your experiments and its details.

1.  To list all experiments, use the following code. Use the **+
    Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to the
    notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it
    ```
    import mlflow
    experiments = mlflow.search_experiments()
    for exp in experiments:
        print(exp.name)
    ```

> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

2.  To retrieve a specific experiment, you can get it by its name. Use
    the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to
    the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it
    ```
    experiment_name = "experiment-diabetes"
    exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
    print(exp)
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](./media/image34.png)

3.  Using an experiment name, you can retrieve all jobs of that
    experiment. Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a
    new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it.
    Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.

 +++mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id)+++

  ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](./media/image35.png)

4.  To more easily compare job runs and outputs, you can configure the
    search to order the results. For example, the following cell orders
    the results by *start_time*, and only shows a maximum of 2 results.

5.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.

   ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](./media/image36.png)

6.  Finally, you can plot the evaluation metrics of multiple models next
    to each other to easily compare models:

7.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.
    ```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       
    df_results = mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)[["metrics.training_r2_score", "params.estimator"]]
       
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(df_results["params.estimator"], df_results["metrics.training_r2_score"])
    ax.set_xlabel("Estimator")
    ax.set_ylabel("R2 score")
    ax.set_title("R2 score by Estimator")
    for i, v in enumerate(df_results["metrics.training_r2_score"]):
        ax.text(i, v, str(round(v, 2)), ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
    plt.show()

**Summary**

You’ve created a workspace in Microsoft Fabric with a trial enabled.
Then, you’ve proceeded to set up a data lakehouse, ingested data for
analysis, and created a notebook for interactive coding. You’ve loaded
data into both Pandas and Spark DataFrames, and subsequently trained
machine learning models using Scikit-Learn while tracking their
performance with MLflow. You’ve effectively managed experiments using
MLflow, listing, retrieving, and ordering runs. Additionally, you’ve
explored experiment results in Microsoft Fabric, visualizing and
comparing model accuracy. The best performing model was saved for future
use, and the notebook was appropriately named and saved. Finally, you’ve
completed the lab by cleaning up resources and deleting the workspace
created for the exercise.
