# Use Case 08: Implementing a Data Science scenario in Microsoft Fabric

**Introduction**

The lifecycle of a Data science project typically includes (often,
iteratively) the following steps:

- Business understanding  
- Data acquisition  
- Data exploration, cleansing, preparation, and visualization  
- Model training and experiment tracking  
- Model scoring and generating insights

The goals and success criteria of each stage depend on collaboration,
data sharing and documentation. The Fabric data science experience
consists of multiple native-built features that enable collaboration,
data acquisition, sharing, and consumption in a seamless way.

In these tutorials, you take the role of a data scientist who has been
given the task to explore, clean, and transform a dataset containing the
churn status of 10000 customers at a bank. You then build a machine
learning model to predict which bank customers are likely to leave.

**Objective**

-  Use the Fabric notebooks for data science scenarios.
-  Ingest data into a Fabric lakehouse using Apache Spark.
-  Load existing data from the lakehouse delta tables.
-  Clean and transform data using Apache Spark and Python based tools.
-  Create experiments and runs to train different machine learning models.
-  Register and track trained models using MLflow and the Fabric UI.
-  Run scoring at scale and save predictions and inference results to the lakehouse.
-  Visualize predictions in Power BI using DirectLake.

## Exercise 1

### Task 1: Create a workspace 

Before working with data in Fabric, create a workspace.

1.  Open your browser, navigate to the address bar, and type or paste
    the following URL: +++https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/+++ then
    press the **Enter** button.

	>[!note] **Note**: If you are directed to Microsoft Fabric Home page, then skip
	> steps from \#2 to \#4.

### Task 2: Create a lakehouse 

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to switch to the *Data
engineering* experience in the portal and create a data lakehouse for
the data files you're going to analyze.

1.  In the Fabric home page, Select **+New item** and filter by, and 
    select, **+++Lakehouse+++**

2.  In the **New lakehouse** dialog box,
    enter **+++FabricData_Sciencelakehouse+++** in the **Name** field,
    click on the **Create** button and open the new lakehouse.

### Task 3: Install custom libraries and load the data

**Bank churn data**

The dataset contains churn status of 10,000 customers. It also includes
attributes that could impact churn such as:

- Credit score  
- Geographical location (Germany, France, Spain)  
- Gender (male, female)  
- Age  
- Tenure (years of being bank's customer)  
- Account balance  
- Estimated salary  
- Number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank  
- Credit card status (whether a customer has a credit card or not)  
- Active member status (whether an active bank's customer or not)  

The dataset also includes columns such as row number, customer ID, and
customer surname that should have no impact on customer's decision to
leave the bank.

The event that defines the customer's churn is the closing of the
customer's bank account. The column exited in the dataset refers to
customer's abandonment. There isn't much context available about these
attributes so you have to proceed without having background information
about the dataset. The aim is to understand how these attributes
contribute to the exited status.

1.  In the **Lakehouse** page, dropdown the **Open notebook** and select
    **New notebook.**

2.  Enter the following code. This code use %pip install to install
    the imblearn library and then stores it in a Fabric lakehouse.
    Select the code cell and click on the **play** button to execute
    cell.
	
    ```

	>[!note]**Note:** The PySpark kernel restarts after %pip install runs. Install
	the needed libraries before you run any other cells.

### Task 12: Add new measures

1.  Add a new measure for the churn rate.

	1.  Select **New measure** in the top ribbon. This action adds a new
    item named **Measure** to
    the **customer_churn_test_predictions** dataset, and opens a formula
    bar above the table.

	1.  To determine the average predicted churn rate, replace Measure = in
    the formula bar with:

		+++Churn Rate = AVERAGE(df_pred_results[CreditScore])+++ 

		> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
		> incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/aipwrdanlytcmsfbrcdepth/refs/heads/Cloud-slice/Labguides/Usecase%2008/media/image92.png)

	1.  To apply the formula, select the **check mark** in the formula bar.
    The new measure appears in the data table. The calculator icon shows
    it was created as a measure.

	1.  Change the format from **General** to **Percentage** in
    the **Properties** panel.

	1.  Scroll down in the **Properties** panel to change the **Decimal
    places** to 1.

2.  Add a new measure that counts the total number of bank customers.
    You'll need it for the rest of the new measures.

	1.  Select **New measure** in the top ribbon to add a new item
    named **Measure** to the customer_churn_test_predictions dataset.
    This action also opens a formula bar above the table.

		> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

	1.  Each prediction represents one customer. To determine the total
	number of customers, replace Measure = in the formula bar with:

		+++Customers = COUNT(df_pred_results[CreditScore])+++

	1.  Select the **check mark** in the formula bar to apply the formula.

3.  Add the churn rate for Germany.

    1.  Select **New measure** in the top ribbon to add a new item
    named **Measure** to the customer_churn_test_predictions
    dataset. This action also opens a formula bar above the table.

		> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

	1.  To determine the churn rate for Germany, replace Measure = in the
	formula bar with:

		```
		Germany Churn = CALCULATE(
			[Churn Rate],
			df_pred_results[Geography_Germany] = 1
		```

	1.  To apply the formula, select the **check mark** in the formula bar.

		> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
		> incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/aipwrdanlytcmsfbrcdepth/refs/heads/Cloud-slice/Labguides/Usecase%2008/media/image98.png)

		This filters the rows down to the ones with Germany as their geography
		(Geography_Germany equals one).

4.  Repeat the above step to add the churn rates for France and Spain.

	1.  **Spain's churn rate**: Select **New measure** in the top ribbon to
		add a new item named **Measure** to the
		customer_churn_test_predictions dataset. This action also opens a
		formula bar above the table.

	1.  Select the **check mark** in the formula bar to apply the formula
	
		```
		Spain Churn = CALCULATE(
			[Churn Rate],
			df_pred_results[Geography_Spain] = 1
		)
		```

1.  France's churn rate: Select **New measure** in the top ribbon to add
    a new item named **Measure** to the customer_churn_test_predictions
    dataset. This action also opens a formula bar above the table.

2.  Select the **check mark** in the formula bar to apply the formula

The Power BI report shows:

- Customers who use more than two of the bank products have a higher
  churn rate although few customers had more than two products. The bank
  should collect more data, but also investigate other features
  correlated with more products (see the plot in the bottom left panel).

- Bank customers in Germany have a higher churn rate than in France and
  Spain (see the plot in the bottom right panel), which suggests that an
  investigation into what has encouraged customers to leave could be
  beneficial.

- There are more middle aged customers (between 25-45) and customers
  between 45-60 tend to exit more.

- Finally, customers with lower credit scores would most likely leave
  the bank for other financial institutes. The bank should look into
  ways that encourage customers with lower credit scores and account
  balances to stay with the bank.
